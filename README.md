## Documentation

## How to Submit a Plugin

1. **Scaffold** your plugin locally:
   ```bash
   plugin-store init my-awesome-plugin
   ```

2. **Develop** your SKILL.md and fill in `plugin.yaml`

3. **Validate** locally:
   ```bash
   plugin-store lint submissions/my-awesome-plugin/
   ```

4. **Fork** this repo, copy your plugin into `submissions/`, and **open a PR**

5. Automated checks run (structure, AI review, security). Once all pass, a maintainer reviews and merges.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.
