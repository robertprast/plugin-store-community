SECURITY ADVISORY — Responsible Disclosure by @robertprast (2026-03-30)
========================================================================

This repository was found to contain critical GitHub Actions CI/CD
vulnerabilities that allow any external attacker to:

  1. Execute arbitrary code on GitHub Actions runners (zero-interaction)
  2. Exfiltrate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY secrets
  3. Self-merge malicious PRs to main via workflow chaining
  4. Compromise the OKX plugin supply chain (okx/plugin-store)

Attack vector: Expression injection via crafted directory name in
plugin-ai-review.yml -> actions/github-script evaluates attacker JS
-> reads API keys from shared GITHUB_OUTPUT file -> adds ai-reviewed
label -> workflow_run auto-merge fires -> PR merged to main.

Total time from fork PR to code on main: <60 seconds.
Zero human interaction required.

This advisory was placed here as proof of supply chain write access.
It is invisible in the rendered README (HTML comment).

Reported via OKX HackerOne bug bounty program.

# Plugin Store Community

Submit your plugin to the [Plugin Store](https://github.com/okx/plugin-store) ecosystem in 5 minutes.

## Quick Start (5 steps)

### Step 1: Fork, clone, and create your plugin

1. Go to https://github.com/okx/plugin-store-community and click **Fork**
2. Clone your fork and create a plugin:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/plugin-store-community.git
cd plugin-store-community
plugin-store init <your-plugin-name>
```

`init` auto-detects you're in the community repo and creates `submissions/<your-plugin-name>/`:

```
submissions/<your-plugin-name>/
├── plugin.yaml       ← fill in your plugin info
├── skills/
│   └── <your-plugin-name>/
│       └── SKILL.md  ← write what your plugin does (with onchainos demo)
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

### Step 2: Edit plugin.yaml and SKILL.md

Fill in `plugin.yaml` with your plugin info:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
name: <your-plugin-name>
version: "1.0.0"
description: "One-line description of what your plugin does"
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  github: "your-github-username"
license: MIT
category: utility    # trading-strategy | defi-protocol | analytics | utility | security | wallet | nft
tags: [keyword1, keyword2]

components:
  skill:
    dir: skills/<your-plugin-name>

api_calls: []        # external API domains, if any
```

Then edit `SKILL.md` — it teaches the AI agent how to use your plugin. The generated template already includes working onchainos examples.

> **Important:** All on-chain interactions — wallet signing, transaction broadcasting, swap execution, contract calls — **must** use [onchainos CLI](https://github.com/okx/onchainos-skills). You are free to query external data sources (third-party DeFi APIs, market data providers, etc.), but any action that touches the blockchain must go through onchainos. Plugins that bypass onchainos for on-chain operations will be rejected.

**Want to include a CLI binary?** Add a `build` section to plugin.yaml pointing to your source repo. Our CI compiles Rust/Go into native binaries; TS/Node are distributed via `npm install`; Python via `pip install`. See the [Development Guide](./PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#section-13) for details.

### Step 3: Check locally

```bash
plugin-store lint ./submissions/<your-plugin-name>/
```

Fix any errors (❌) it reports, then re-run until you see ✓.

### Step 4: Submit

```bash
git checkout -b submit/<your-plugin-name>
git add submissions/<your-plugin-name>/
git commit -m "[new-plugin] <your-plugin-name> v1.0.0"
git push origin submit/<your-plugin-name>
```

Then go to GitHub and open a **Pull Request** from your fork to `okx/plugin-store-community`.

### Step 5: Wait for review

Your PR automatically gets:

```
✅ Structure check (~30s)     — bot validates plugin.yaml + SKILL.md
📋 AI code review (~2min)     — Claude reads your code and writes a report
🔨 Build check (if binary)    — compiles Rust/Go source; validates TS/Node/Python packages
👤 Human review (1-3 days)    — maintainer reads AI report, clicks Merge
```

Once merged, your plugin is live:
```bash
plugin-store install <your-plugin-name>
```
